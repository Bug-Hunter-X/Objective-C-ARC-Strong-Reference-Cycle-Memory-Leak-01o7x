To solve the strong reference cycle, use `weak` references where appropriate.  A `weak` reference doesn't increment the retain count.  Modify the code like so:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (weak, nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (weak, nonatomic) MyClass *myObject;
@end

// ... implementation remains the same ...
```
By making at least one of the properties `weak`, the retain cycle is broken, allowing the objects to be deallocated when they are no longer needed.  In this case, either property can be made `weak` to correct the bug.  Choosing which one should be `weak` depends on the specific logic and design of your classes.
