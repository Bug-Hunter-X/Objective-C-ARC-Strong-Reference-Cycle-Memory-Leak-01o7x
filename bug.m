In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, creating strong reference cycles can lead to memory leaks. This typically happens when two objects retain each other, preventing either from being deallocated even when they're no longer needed. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"AnotherClass deallocated");
}
@end

int main() {
    MyClass *myInstance = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    AnotherClass *anotherInstance = [[AnotherClass alloc] init];
    myInstance.anotherObject = anotherInstance;
    anotherInstance.myObject = myInstance; 
    //Neither object will be deallocated until the app exits.
    return 0;
}
```
This creates a retain cycle; `myInstance` strongly references `anotherInstance`, and vice versa.  Neither object's reference count ever reaches zero.
